# MultiBEA: Multi-Threaded Binary Evolutionary Algorithm
It is an implementation of the evolutionary 
algorithm InCEA that uses SIMD and logical operation instructions to access and modify data, with some minor
modifications to the original method to increase efficiency and performance. This implementation reduces 
time and space costs by magnitudes compared to the original implementation. The algorithm mainly targets 
weighted-vertex graph coloring problems, like register allocation.
