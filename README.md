# MBGA: Multi-Threaded Binary Genetic Algorithm
It is an implementation of the evolutionary algorithm InCEA that uses SIMD and logical operation instructions to access and modify data, with some minor modifications to the original method to increase efficiency and performance. This implementation reduces time and space costs by magnitudes compared to the original implementation. The algorithm mainly targets weighted-vertex graph coloring problems, like register allocation.
